# How to Create a Vue 3 PWA with Vite

The combination of Vite, Vue 3, and Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) hasn't been widely explored by developers, especially those who write documentation. It's a relatively new area, so the process to create a Vue 3 PWA with Vite, which also builds and runs on XXAMP, was a whole new frontier. But I am nothing if not a pioneer

## Initializing the Project
Most documentation points to PWAs being built in Vue 2 or using vue-cli. Both are old now. Vite is the new tooling but there is some shimmy sham you can do to get a PWA working in Vite + Vue 3.

Initialize the project like so:

```bash
npm create vue@latest
```

Pick all the options you like.

```bash
cd your-app
npm install
```

Now you're in your app directory installing the basic Vue packages.

After thats done, install the vite-pwa plugin like so:

```bash
npm i vite-plugin-pwa
```

Inside of the `vite.config.js` file in your project, make sure it looks like this, especially importing the VitePWA and assigning the associated plugin:

```javascript
import { fileURLToPath, URL } from 'node:url'

import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import vue from '@vitejs/plugin-vue'
import vueJsx from '@vitejs/plugin-vue-jsx'
import { VitePWA } from 'vite-plugin-pwa'

// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    vue(),
    vueJsx(),
    VitePWA({
      registerType: 'autoUpdate',
      injectRegister: 'auto',
    }),
  ],
  resolve: {
    alias: {
      '@': fileURLToPath(new URL('./src', import.meta.url))
    }
  }
})
```

Then run `npm run build` to create your app in the `dist/` folder.

## Running the Build from XAMPP

A deployed PWA needs to be deployed at the exact root of the web server. This is because there is source-mapping going on behind the scenes in the build that makes that assumption. There are ways to adjust this mapping, but I am lazy. The `htdocs` folder in XAMPP IS the root folder of an Apache web server. So if you delete everything out of that, and paste the contents of your `dist` folder into the `htdocs` folder, you can run the web app that way. You can still have an API running out of an `htdocs/api/` folder in there if you want. Note that visiting your API endpoints in the browser won't work, since it will think you're accessing a weird app view, but requests from outside the app still work for endpoint testing.

## Installing the PWA

Once you clear your cache, and run from localhost, you will see the app! If you serve to the network |npm run dev -- --host| you can do the same by visiting the site from your phone. To install (in Edge on a computer) go to the three dots menu in the browser, hover over Apps > and you should see an Install App button! Some browsers are better at detecting PWAs in general, and if we want to fine-tune our manifest file to make all browsers like us, we can.

## Distributing the PWA
Serve the build from a server where it can sit directly on the Document Root, and be accessed with HTTPS://. Client-side routing means you can do it from GitHub Pages!

## THE IMPORTANT BIT

You don't need to do any of this to see the app and work on it while developing. This is a release process. To view the app in development, just use:

```bash
npm run dev
```
